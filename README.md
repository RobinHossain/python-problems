# Python Problems
### File Structures
```
1. get_class_depth.py
2. get_depth.py
3. get_lca.py
4. unit_test.py
```
### Run Instructions
I used Python3 to write codes. If you run "unit_test.py" you will get output of all files. Also you would be able to run particular file to get output result. In that case have to uncomment the print output lines from each task file.

```
python3 unit_test.py
```
